# ShardMiner
Vision: A centralized service that lets creators of shards submit their shard to:
- Track downloads for the popularity of a shard
- Cached source code for latest versions of popular shards
- Easier searching for a shard and it's utilty
- Security review of a shards code to ensure malicious code isn't being spread through well-meaning open-source projects
